# Calorio

![Calorio logo](./docs/assets/calorio-logo.png)

Calorio allows folks to track their calories, steps, and water consumption each day to help make steady progress towards healthy living.

## Intent

This is a work-in-progress application in which I aim to showcase UI engineering and design skills while also leveraging AI assistance for additional full stack development.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
